### Description

LightQ is a game of mirrors, light and IQ ! it's a logic puzzle game that will proof your knowledge of merging light and reflections. The goal is to get all coins spin by sending a beam of light of the same color over it. This is a COMPLETE game with menu, sounds, music, intro, players, levelpack, editor (for making your own puzzles) and more ! you need the DirectX 8.0 type library (for sound). Further this code is based on the windows GDI32 DLL. In future i will convert it to pure directx for more platform support. Please let me know incorrect code behaviour. For now check it and have a lot of fun playing this game!!!

I tested it on a Pentium II 350 Mhz with 128 MB, WinME, it was very slow. I tested it on a AMD Athlon XP 2400+, 512 MB, WinXP, it runs superb !!!

directx 8.0 type library on system for sound, uses GDI32.DLL for drawing
